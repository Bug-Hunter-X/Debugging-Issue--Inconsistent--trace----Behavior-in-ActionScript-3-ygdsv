# ActionScript 3 Trace Debugging Issue

This repository demonstrates an issue with the `trace()` function in ActionScript 3, where the output isn't always consistently visible in certain environments.  The problem stems from the way Flash Player handles the output and how it interacts with browser consoles.

The `AS3TraceBug.as` file contains the problematic code snippet.  The `AS3TraceBugSolution.as` file demonstrates an improved solution, offering methods for getting reliable trace output.

## Problem Description

The core problem is that `trace()` statements may not always appear in a location that's easy to find, such as the browser's developer console.  This makes debugging more difficult.

## Solution

The solution explores more reliable methods for outputting debugging information, offering alternatives to `trace()` for situations where consistent visibility is crucial.
